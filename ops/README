This directory contains an Ant build script (that depends on the JSch
tasks) that will build/configure Voldemort nodes on EC2.

The work of setting up EC2 instances, IPs, etc., is expected to be
already done; this just does the work of pushing Voldemort and
configurations out to individual nodes.

The work of building a Voldemort version that you're happy with is
also expected to be already done; the script uploads an archive from
this directory.

You need a directory called "keys" that contains the SSH key you
will use to access the nodes.

Examples:

Set up a node.
  ant -Dnode=vn1 setup-node

Stop all nodes:
  for i in vn1 vn2; do ant -Dnode=${i} stop; done
